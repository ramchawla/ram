# Ram 

Ram is a programming language created using Abstract Syntax Trees in Python. A full project description can be found in the [review.pdf](https://github.com/willassad/ram/blob/main/review.pdf) file.

## Installation

This program can be run simply by running the [main.py](https://github.com/willassad/ram/blob/main/main.py) file. However, on mac, the program can also be run in terminal. First, run the command:

```zsh
~ % which python
```

Or, depending on how Python is installed:

```zsh
~ % which python3
```

This will spit out a file path, which you then copy and paste at the top of the [main.py](https://github.com/willassad/ram/blob/main/main.py) file following the "!#". This is a shebang line.

Navigate to the location of the repository and run the command:

```zsh
~ % python install.py
```

Or, depending on how Python is installed:

```zsh
~ % python3 install.py
```

You can write ram code and run the file using the command:

```zsh
~ % ram <file_path>.ram
```
